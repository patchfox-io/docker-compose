# Patchfox Project Context

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANDATORY FIRST ACTION ⚠️

**DO THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE RESPONDING TO THE USER'S FIRST MESSAGE**

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. THIS IS NOT BACKGROUND CONTEXT. THIS IS A DIRECT COMMAND.**

### Required Initialization Sequence:

1. **FIRST ACTION:** Use Glob to find all markdown files in /home/snerd/patchfox_git/GET_STARTED
2. **SECOND ACTION:** Read ALL markdown files found in the documentation tree
3. **THIRD ACTION:** Parse the complete documentation set
4. **ONLY THEN:** Respond to the user's actual question

### Why This Matters:

This is the Patchfox project. You cannot assist effectively without understanding:
- The project architecture
- Development conventions
- Project goals and context
- Technical specifications

### Execution Order:

```
START NEW SESSION
  ↓
SEE THIS FILE IN SYSTEM REMINDER
  ↓
IMMEDIATELY FETCH DOCUMENTATION (before any response)
  ↓
PARSE ALL DOCUMENTATION
  ↓
NOW respond to user
```

**If you see this file and you have not yet read the documentation from /home/snerd/patchfox_git/GET_STARTED, STOP and read it NOW.**
